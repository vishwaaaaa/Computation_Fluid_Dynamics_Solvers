## Computational Fluid Dynamics Solver
Developing the cfd solver in a challenging task. Depending of the physics to be studied the flux evaluation (for finite volume) methods need to selected.
In this repository we look :
1. Adaptive mesh refinement studies
2. Curved elements
3. Different flux evaluation techniques
4. Different time stepping schemes

## Coding Language
All the code is developed in `C++` with an exception for the mesh generating alogrithms which are writting `MATLAB`
